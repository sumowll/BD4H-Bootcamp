Homework of this class will be distributed through [Canvas](http://gatech.instructure.com/). All homework material can only be used within class.

## Discussion

For questions regarding homework, we encourage you to use piazza to raise discussion and we will answer ASAP. If necessary you can email [instructor and TAs](/contact.html). Remote TA office hour will be hosted through meeting software.<!--For on-campus students, we will schedule TA office hours.-->

## Submission
We will use Canvas and Gradescope for assignments/project submission this semester, please check more details in each assignment/project description, failure to follow guidelines will yield nothing finally.
As a practical class, we will have a lot of **programming questions**. Please strictly follow submission instructions in each homework, especially naming and structure of submission. It's your responsibility to make sure your submission is compilable and runnable in standard teaching environment with provided code skeleton. Non-runnable code will directly lead to 0 score. You are not allowed to change any existing function or class names from provided skeleton code unless got permission from instructor or TA. Otherwise, your submission may fail our tests and got penalty in your score.

## COLLABORATION & GROUP WORK

Homework assignments are strictly individual efforts, while final projects are done by small groups. You can discuss high level concepts regarding to lectures or homework on the forum but you shouldn't share your own (or others') solution and code with other students through any means, and we will use anti-cheating software to avoid cheating.

## EXTENSIONS, LATE ASSIGNMENTS, & RE-SCHEDULED/MISSED EXAMS

Each student is allowed 2 days of late submission in total to be used for HOMEWORK only. You can split the 2 days grace period across two different homework (20 hours will be counted as 1 day and 30 hours counted as 2 days). Once you have used up your late days, late assignments will be penalized at 10 pts per day. Assignments more than 4 days late will not be accepted. Also, you can't apply it toward final project or Kaggle. We don't consider ANY other homework extension excuses except healthcare emergency incident (doctor's proof is required), so please split the given grace period well and make appropriate arrangements in advance.
